# Hsuan Leet Code

Hsuan's LeetCode solution notes.
This repository contains my personal implementations of LeetCode problems, along with explanations and, when available, approaches and complexity analysis.

---

## Repository Structure

- Each file in `src/` corresponds to a single LeetCode problem.
- File names follow the format: `problemNumber-problemName.ts` or `problemNumber-problemName.sql`.
- Most files include:
  - Problem description
  - Implementation
  - Optional approach / method explanation
  - Optional time and space complexity analysis
- Solutions are primarily in **TypeScript**, but some problems may use **SQL** or other languages.
